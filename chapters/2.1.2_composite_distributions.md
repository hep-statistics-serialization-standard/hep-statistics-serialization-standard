### Composite distributions 
This section contains composite distributions in the sense that they refer to other distribution which they combine or modify in some way. 
The of the mixture distribution, sometimes called additions of distributions, is a (weighted) sum of distributions $f_i(\vec{x})$, depending on the same variable(s) $\vec{x}$: 



$$
\begin{aligned} \text{MixturePdf}(x) = \frac{1}{\ensuremath{\mathcal{M}}}\sum_{i=1}^{n} c_i \cdot f_i(\vec{x}) , \end{aligned} 
$$



where the $c_i$ are coefficients and $\vec{x}$ is the vector of variables. 
-   `name`: custom unique string 
-   `type`: `mixture_dist` 
-   `name`: name of the variable $x$ ([optional]{.smallcaps}, since the     variable is fully defined by the summands) 
-   `summands`: array of names referencing distributions 
-   `coefficients`: array of names of coefficients $c_i$ or numbers to     be added 
-   `extended`: boolean denoting whether this is an extended     distribution ([optional]{.smallcaps}, as it can be inferred from the     lengths of the lists for `summands` and `coefficients`) 
This distribution can be treated as extended or as non-extended. 
-   If the number of coefficients equals the number of distributions and     'extended' is 'false', then the sum of the coefficient must be     (approximately) one. 
-   If the number of coefficients equals the number of distributions and     'extended' is 'true', then the sum of the coefficients will be used     as the Poisson rate parameter and the mixture distribution itself     will use the coefficients normalized by their sum. 
-   If the number of coefficients is one less than the number of     distributions, then 'extended' must be 'false' and $c_n$ is computed     from the other coefficients as 



$$
\begin{aligned}     c_n &= 1 - \sum_{i=1}^{n-1}c_i .     \end{aligned} 
$$




[]{#sec:product-distribution label="sec:product-distribution"} 
The of the product of s of independent distributions $f_i$ is defined as 



$$
\begin{aligned} \text{ProductPdf}(x) &= \frac{1}{\ensuremath{\mathcal{M}}}\prod_i^n f(x). \end{aligned} 
$$



-   `name`: custom string 
-   `type`: `product_dist` 
-   `x`: name of the variable $x$ ([optional]{.smallcaps}, since the     variable is fully defined by the factors) 
-   `factors`: array of names referencing distributions 
A distribution that is specified via a non-normalized density function $f(x)$. Formally, it corresponds to the probability measure that has the density $f(x)$ in respect to the Lebesgue measure. 
The density function is normalized automatically by $\ensuremath{\mathcal{M}}= \int f(x) dx$, so the PDF of the distribution is 



$$
\begin{aligned} \text{DensityFunctionPdf}(f, x) &= \frac{f(x)}{\ensuremath{\mathcal{M}}} \end{aligned} 
$$



The distribution can be specified either via the non-normalized density function $f(x)$ or via the non-normalized log-density function $\log(f(x))$: 
-   $\texttt{density\_function\_dist}$: Specified via the PDF $f(x)$ 
    -   `name`: custom string 
    -   `type`: `density_function_dist` 
    -   `function`: The density function $f$ 
-   $\texttt{log\_density\_function\_dist}$: Specified via the PDF     $f(x)$ 
    -   `name`: custom string 
    -   `type`: `log_density_function_dist` 
    -   `function`: The density function $f$ 

[]{#dist:poisson-point-process label="dist:poisson-point-process"} 
A Poisson point process distribution is understood here as the distribution of the outcomes of a (typically inhomogeneous) Poisson point process. In particle physics, such a distribution is often called an extended distribution [@barlow-extended-ml]. 
In HS<sup>3</sup>, a Poisson point process distribution is specified using a global-rate parameter $\lambda$ and an underlying distribution $m$, either explicitly or implicitly (see below). 
Random values are drawn from the Poisson point process distribution by drawing a random number $n$ from a Poisson distribution of the global-rate $\lambda$, and then drawing $n$ random values from the underlying distribution $m$. The resulting random values are vectors $x$ of length $n$, so their length varies. 
The PDF the Poisson point process distribution at an outcome $x$ (a vector of length $n$) is 



$$
\begin{aligned} \text{PoissonPointProcessPdf}(\lambda, m, x) &= \text{PoissonPdf}(n, \lambda) \cdot \prod_i^n \text{PDF}(m, x_i). \end{aligned} 
$$



In particle physics, the function $\text{PoissonPointProcessPdf}(\lambda, m(\theta), x)$, for a fixed observation $x$ and varying parameters $\lambda$ and $\theta$, is often called an extended likelihood. 
A a poisson point process distribution can be specified in HS<sup>3</sup> in two ways: 
-   $\texttt{rate\_extended\_dist}$: The global-rate parameter $\lambda$     and underlying distribution $m$ are specified explicitly: 
    -   `name`: custom string 
    -   `type`: `rate_extended_dist` 
    -   `rate`: The global rate $\lambda$ 
    -   `dist`: The underlying distribution $m$ 
    The name of the variable $x$ is taken from the underlying     distribution. The underlying distribution [must]{.smallcaps} not be     referred to from other components of the statistical model. 
-   $\texttt{rate\_density\_dist}$: Specified via a non-normalized     rate-density function $f$. Both the global-rate parameter and the     underlying distribution are implicit: $\lambda = \int f(y) d y$ and     $m = \text{density\_function\_dist}(f)$. 
    More formally, the distribution corresponds to the inhomogeneous     Poisson point process that is defined by a non-normalized rate     measure which has density $f$ in respect to the Lebesque measure. 
    -   `name`: custom string 
    -   `type`: `rate_density_dist` 
    -   `x`: name of the variable $x$ 
    -   `density`: The rate-density function $f$ 

[]{#dist:bin-counts label="dist:bin-counts"} 
This is a binned version of the Poisson point process distribution 
([\[dist:poisson-point-process\]](#dist:poisson-point-process){reference-type="ref" reference="dist:poisson-point-process"}). Is is the distribution of the bin counts that result from histogramming the outcomes of a Poisson point process distribution using a given binning scheme (see 
[\[sec:binned-data\]](#sec:binned-data){reference-type="ref" reference="sec:binned-data"}). 
Like the Poisson point process distribution, a Bin-counts distribution can either be specified via a global-rate parameter $\lambda$ and an underlying distribution $m$, or via a rate-density function $f$ (in which case $\lambda$ and $m$ are implicit). In addition, the binning scheme also has to be specified in either case, unless it can be inferred (see below). 
For $k$ bins, this type of distribution corresponds to a product of $k$ Poisson distributions with rates 



$$
\begin{aligned} \nu_i &= \lambda \cdot \int_{\text{bin}_i} \text{PDF}(y, m) dy \quad \text{equivalent to}\\ \nu_i &= \int_{\text{bin}_i} f(y) dy \end{aligned} 
$$



The PDF the Bin-counts distribution at an outcome $x$ (a vector of length $k$, same as the number of bins) is 



$$
\begin{aligned} \text{BinCountsPdf}(x) &= \prod_i^k \text{PoissonPdf}(x_i, \nu_i) \end{aligned} 
$$



-   $\texttt{bincounts\_extended\_dist}$: The global-rate parameter     $\lambda$ and underlying distribution $m$ are specified explicitly:

    -   `type`: `bincounts_extended_dist` 
    -   `rate`: The global rate $\lambda$ 
    -   `dist`: The underlying distribution $m$ 
    -   `axes`: a definition of the binning to be used, following the         defintions in 
        [\[sec:binned-data\]](#sec:binned-data){reference-type="ref"         reference="sec:binned-data"}. [optional]{.smallcaps} if `dist`         is a binned distribution, in which case the same binning is used         by default. 
    The name of the variable $x$ is taken from the underlying     distribution. The underlying distribution [must]{.smallcaps} not be     referred to from other components of the statistical model. 
-   $\texttt{bincounts\_density\_dist}$: Specified via a non-normalized     rate-density function $f$. Both the global-rate parameter and the     underlying distribution are implicit: $\lambda = \int f(y) dy$ and     $m = \text{density\_function\_dist}(f)$.
