## Analyses {#sec:analyses} 
The top-level component `analyses` contains an array of possible (automated) analyses. To that extent, likelihoods, parameters of interest and the affiliated domains are listed. Description of the components: 
::: keyslong custom string 
name as reference to a likelihood defined in the top-level component `likelihoods` 
([optional]{.smallcaps}) array of names as reference to parameters that are interesting for the analysis at hand 
name of a domain to be used for the parameters, defined in the top-level component `domains` 
([optional]{.smallcaps}) name of an initial value to be used, defined in the top-level component `parameter_points` 
([optional]{.smallcaps}) name of a prior distribution, defined in the top-level component `distributions`. This is only used for Bayesian interpretations and should not be confused with auxiliary distributions listed in the likelihood section. The prior could, for example, be a product distribution of all the individual priors. If for any parameter, both a prior and a parameter domain are given, the prior should be truncated to the given parameter domain. Otherwise, implicit flat priors over the given parameter domain are assumed. ::: 
All parameters of all distributions in the likelihood must either be listed under the domain referenced, or set to `const` in the parameter point referenced.
