## Miscellaneous {#sec:misc} 
The top-level component `misc` can contain arbitrary, user-created information in struct format. 
``` {title="Example: Miscellaneous"} "misc" : { "customkey1" : "custom information 1" , "myPackage_internal" : { "somekey" : "custom info only affecting myPackage", "default_color_for_all_curves" : "fuchsia" } } ```

-   colors and styles for drawing distributions in this file 
-   suggested settings for samplers or minimizers when working with the     distributions in this file 
-   comments explaining design choices made when building the model in     this file 
-   suggested names and paths for output files to be used by backends     working with this file
