## Data {#sec:data} 
The top-level component `data` contains an array of data sets in struct format. Each data set needs to contain the components `type` and `name`. Other components are dependent on the type of data set as demonstrated below: 

-   `name`: custom string 
-   `type`: string that determines the format of the observations 
-   `...`: each type of observations has different parameter keys. Some     of these are [optional]{.smallcaps} and marked accordingly in the     more detailed description below 

A detailed description of the different types with examples can be found below. 
While data, in most settings, has no uncertainty attached to it, this standard *does* allow to provide data with uncertainty, as there are some settings in which uncorrelated or correlated errors need to be taken into account. These include cases such as 

-   generated data obtained from importance sampling, including a     (potentially Gaussian) uncertainty from the frequency weights 
-   unfolded data, resulting from arbitrarily complex transformation     functions involving statistical models folding some degree of     uncertainty into the data points themselves 

While it should always be preferred to publish "raw" data, e.g. along with the statistical model used for its unfolding to inferred particle-level observables, allowing use of pre-processed data with corresponding uncertainties expands the possible applications considerably.
The uncertainties encoded in this way on the data will normally need to be mapped into the statistical model with appropriate nuisance parameters, which can be named in declaration of the data-uncertainties using the same form as for distributions/constraints.


### Point data 
Point data describes a measurement of a single number, with a possible uncertainty (error). 

-   `name`: custom string 
-   `type`: `point` 
-   `value`: value of this data point 
-   `uncertainty`: ([optional]{.smallcaps}) uncertainty of this data     point 

```json title="Example: Point Data"
"data":[ 
	{ 
		"name":"data1", 
		"type":"point", 
		"value":0., 
		"uncertainty":1. 
	} 
]
``` 

### Unbinned data 
Unbinned data describes a measurement of multiple data points in a possibly multi-dimensional space of variables. These data points can be weighted. 

-   `name`: custom string 
-   `type`: `unbinned` 
-   `entries`: array of arrays containing the coordinates/entries of the     data 
-   `axes`: array of structs representing the axes. Each struct     [must]{.smallcaps} have the components `name` as well as `max` and     `min`. 
-   `weights`: ([optional]{.smallcaps}) array of values containing the     weights of the individual data points, to be used for $\chi^2$     comparisons and fits. If this component is not given, weight 1 is     assumed for all data points. If given, the array needs to be of the     same length as `entries`. 
-   `entries_uncertainties`: ([optional]{.smallcaps}) array of arrays     containing the errors/uncertainties of each entry. If given, the     array needs to be of the same shape as `entries`. 
```json title="Example: Unbinned Data"
"data":[ 
  { 
    "name":"data1", 
    "type":"unbinned", 
    "weights":[ 9.0, 18.4 ], 
    "entries":[ [1,3], [2,9] ], 
    "entries_uncertainties":[ [0.3], [0.6] ], 
    "axes":[ 
      { "name":"variable1", "min":1, "max":3 }, 
      { "name":"variable2", "min":-10, "max":10 }, 
      ... 
    ] 
  }, 
  ... 
]
``` 

### Binned data {#sec:binned-data} 
Binned data describes a histogram of data points with bin contents in a possibly multi-dimensional space of variables. Whether entries that fall precisely on the bin boundaries are sorted into the smaller or larger bin is under the discretion of the creator of the model and thus not defined. 

-   `name`: custom string 
-   `type`: `binned` 
-   `contents`: array of values representing the contents of the binned     data set 
-   `axes`: array of structs representing the axes. Each struct     [must]{.smallcaps} have the component `name`. Further, it must     specify the binning through one of these two options: 
    1.  regular binnings are specified through the components `max`,         `min` and `nbins` 
    2.  potentially irregular binnings are specified through the         component `edges`, which contains an array of length $n+1$,         where the first and last entries denote the minimum and and         maximum of the variable, and all entries between denote the         intermediate bin boundaries. 
-   `uncertainty`: ([optional]{.smallcaps}) struct representing the     uncertainty of the contents. It consists of the following mandatory component:
    -   `type`: denoting the kind of uncertainty coding; symmetric, Gaussian-distributed uncertainties with optional bin-to-bin correlations are denoted as `gaussian_uncertainty`, and general asymmetric uncertainties via template interpolation as `modifier_uncertainty`

    The following extra entries are used by the `gaussian_uncertainty`:
    -   `sigma`: array of the standard deviation of the entries in         `contents`. Needs to be of the same length as `contents` 
    -   `correlation`: ([optional]{.smallcaps}) array of arrays denoting         the correlation between the contents in matrix format. Must be         of dimension length of `contents` $\times$ length of `contents`.         It can also be set to 0 to indicate no correlation. 

    The following extra entries are used by the `modifier_uncertainty`:
    -   `modifiers`: array of structs with each struct containing a component `type` of the modifier (usually `histosys` will be appropriate for published data; a related `histosys_delta` may be used to express the same logic as `histosys` but with the values interpreted as signed, additive shifts from the `contents` variable), as well as a component `parameter` (defining a string) or a component `parameters` (defining an array     of strings) relating to the name or names of parameters controlling     this modifier. Further ([optional]{.smallcaps}) components are     `data` and `constraint`, both depending on the type of modifier. For details on these components, see the section on HistFactory distributions.

  
```json title="Example: Binned Data"
"data":[ 
  { 
    "name":"data2", 
    "type":"binned", 
    "contents":[ 9.0, 18.4 ], 
    "axes":[ { "name":"variable1", "nbins":2, "min":1, "max":3 } ] 
  }, 
  { 
    "name":"asimov_data2",
    "type":"binned", 
    "contents":[ 9.0, 18.4, 13, 0. ], 
    "axes":[ 
      { "name":"variable1", "nbins":2, "min":1, "max":3 }, 
      { "name":"variable2", "edges"[0,10,100] } 
    ] 
  }, 
    ... 
  ]
``` 

This type can also be used to store pre-processed data utilizing the `uncertainty` component 

```json title="Example: Pre-processed binned Data"
"data":[ 
  { 
    "name":"data4", 
    "type":"binned", 
    "contents":[ 9.0, 18.4 ], 
    "uncertainty" : { 
      "type": "gaussian_uncertainty", 
      "correlation" : 0, 
      "sigma" : [ 3, 4 ]
     }, 
    "axes":[ 
      { "name":"variable1", "nbins":2, "min":1, "max":3 }, 
      ... 
    ] 
  }, 
  ... 
] 
```
