## Data {#sec:data} 
The top-level component `data` contains an array of data sets in struct format. Each data set needs to contain the components `type` and `name`. Other components are dependent on the type of data set as demonstrated below: 
-   `name`: custom string 
-   `type`: string that determines the format of the observations 
-   `...`: each type of observations has different parameter keys. Some     of these are [optional]{.smallcaps} and marked accordingly in the     more detailed description below 
A detailed description of the different types with examples can be found below. 
While data, in most settings, has no uncertainty attached to it, this standard *does* allow to provide data with uncertainty, as there are some settings in which uncorrelated or correlated errors need to be taken into account. These include cases such as 
-   generated data obtained from importance sampling, including a     (potentially Gaussian) uncertainty from the frequency weights 
-   unfolded data, resulting from arbitrarily complex transformation     functions involving statistical models folding some degree of     uncertainty into the data points themselves 
While it should always be preferred to publish "raw" data, allowing to include pre-processed data with corresponding uncertainties expands the possible applications considerably. 

### Point Data 
Point data describes a measurement of a single number, with a possible uncertainty (error). 
-   `name`: custom string 
-   `type`: `point` 
-   `value`: value of this data point 
-   `uncertainty`: ([optional]{.smallcaps}) uncertainty of this data     point 
``` {title="Example: Point Data"} "data":[ { "name":"data1", "type":"point", "value":0., "uncertainty":1. } ] ``` 

### Unbinned Data 
Unbinned data describes a measurement of multiple data points in a possibly multi-dimensional space of variables. These data points can be weighted. 
-   `name`: custom string 
-   `type`: `unbinned` 
-   `entries`: array of arrays containing the coordinates/entries of the     data 
-   `axes`: array of structs representing the axes. Each struct     [must]{.smallcaps} have the components `name` as well as `max` and     `min`. 
-   `weights`: ([optional]{.smallcaps}) array of values containing the     weights of the individual data points, to be used for $\chi^2$     comparisons and fits. If this component is not given, weight 1 is     assumed for all data points. If given, the array needs to be of the     same length as `entries`. 
-   `entries_uncertainties`: ([optional]{.smallcaps}) array of arrays     containing the errors/uncertainties of each entry. If given, the     array needs to be of the same shape as `entries`. 
``` {title="Example: Unbinned Data"} "data":[ { "name":"data1", "type":"unbinned", "weights":[ 9.0, 18.4 ], "entries":[ [1,3], [2,9] ], "entries_uncertainties":[ [0.3], [0.6] ], "axes":[ { "name":"variable1", "min":1, "max":3 }, { "name":"variable2", "min":-10, "max":10 }, ... ] }, ... ] ``` 

### Binned Data {#sec:binned-data} 
Binned data describes a histogram of data points with bin contents in a possibly multi-dimensional space of variables. Whether entries that fall precisely on the bin boundaries are sorted into the smaller or larger bin is under the discretion of the creator of the model and thus not defined. 
-   `name`: custom string 
-   `type`: `binned` 
-   `contents`: array of values representing the contents of the binned     data set 
-   `axes`: array of structs representing the axes. Each struct     [must]{.smallcaps} have the component `name`. Further, it must     specify the binning through one of these two options: 
    1.  regular binnings are specified through the components `max`,         `min` and `nbins` 
    2.  potentially irregular binnings are specified through the         component `edges`, which contains an array of length $n+1$,         where the first and last entries denote the minimum and and         maximum of the variable, and all entries between denote the         intermediate bin boundaries. 
-   `uncertainty`: ([optional]{.smallcaps}) struct representing the     uncertainty of the contents. It consists of up to three components: 
    -   `type`: denoting the kind of uncertainty, for now only Gaussian         distributed uncertainties denoted as `gaussian_uncertainty` are         supported 
    -   `sigma`: array of the standard deviation of the entries in         `contents`. Needs to be of the same length as `contents` 
    -   `correlation`: ([optional]{.smallcaps}) array of arrays denoting         the correlation between the contents in matrix format. Must be         of dimension length of `contents` $\times$ length of `contents`.         It can also be set to 0 to indicate no correlation. 
``` {title="Example: Binned Data"} "data":[ { "name":"data2", "type":"binned", "contents":[ 9.0, 18.4 ], "axes":[ { "name":"variable1", "nbins":2, "min":1, "max":3 } ] }, { "name":"asimov_data2", "type":"binned", "contents":[ 9.0, 18.4, 13, 0. ], "axes":[ { "name":"variable1", "nbins":2, "min":1, "max":3 }, { "name":"variable2", "edges"[0,10,100] } ] }, ... ] ``` 
This type can also be used to store pre-processed data utilizing the `uncertainty` component 
``` {title="Example: Pre-processed binned Data"} "data":[ { "name":"data4", "type":"binned", "contents":[ 9.0, 18.4 ], "uncertainty" : { "type": "gaussian_uncertainty", "correlation" : 0, "sigma" : [ 3, 4 ] }, "axes":[ { "name":"variable1", "nbins":2, "min":1, "max":3 }, ... ] }, ... ] ```
