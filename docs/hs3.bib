abstract = {Analysis of results from HEP experiments often involves estimation of the composition of a sample of data, based on Monte Carlo simulations of the various sources. Data values (generally of more than one dimension) are binned, and because the numbers of data points in many bins are small, a χ2 minimisation is inappropriate, so a maximum likelihood technique using Poisson statistics is often used. This note shows how to incorporate the fact that the Monte Carlo statistics used are finite and thus subject to statistical fluctuations.}

author = {Roger Barlow},
abstract = {An account is given of the method of extended maximum likelihood. This differs from the standard method of maximum likelihood in that the normalisation of the probability distribution function is allowed to vary. It is thus applicable to problems in which the number of samples obtained is itself a relevant measurement. If the function is such that its size and shape can be independently varied, then the estimates given by the extended method are identical to the standard maximum likelihood estimators, though the errors require care of interpretation. If the function does not have this property, then extended maximum likelihood can give better results.}
